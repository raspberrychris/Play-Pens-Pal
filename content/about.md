# About Play Pens Pal

## Our Story

Play Pens Pal was born from a personal journey that many parents can relate to. As a first-time mother and former child safety consultant, I (Sarah Mitchell) found myself overwhelmed by the countless playpen options available when shopping for my daughter Emma in 2023. Despite my professional background in child safety, I spent weeks researching, comparing products, and reading countless reviews to find the perfect playpen that would keep my active toddler safe while providing an engaging space for her development.

This experience revealed a clear gap in the market: there wasn't a comprehensive, unbiased resource dedicated to helping parents navigate the world of playpens. That's when the idea for Play Pens Pal was born.

## Our Mission

At Play Pens Pal, our mission is simple: to help parents make informed decisions about their children's play spaces. We believe that every child deserves a safe, engaging environment to explore and develop, and every parent deserves peace of mind knowing they've made the right choice for their family.

## What Sets Us Apart

### Expert Knowledge
With my background in child safety consulting and hands-on experience as a parent, each review and guide combines professional expertise with real-world understanding. We don't just list features â€“ we explain why they matter for your child's safety and development.

### Thorough Testing
Every playpen we review goes through a comprehensive evaluation process, considering:
- Safety features and certifications
